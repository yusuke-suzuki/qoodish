# Gemini Code Assist Context for Qoodish

This document provides essential context for Gemini Code Assist to understand the Qoodish project. Please use this information to generate code that is consistent with the existing architecture, conventions, and dependencies.

## 1. Project Overview

- **Name:** Qoodish
- **Description:** A Ruby on Rails API for sharing and discovering information about places through maps. This is the backend for the Qoodish-Web frontend.
- **Repository (Backend):** `github.com/yusuke-suzuki/qoodish`
- **Repository (Frontend):** `github.com/yusuke-suzuki/qoodish-web`

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Ruby on Rails
- **Language:** Ruby
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API Style:** RESTful JSON API
- **Authentication:** Google Sign-In via Firebase.
- **Package Manager:** Bundler

## 3. Architectural Patterns & Conventions

- **Directory Structure:** Standard Rails MVC architecture.
    - `app/controllers`: Controllers handle HTTP requests and render JSON responses.
    - `app/models`: Defines business logic. This includes ActiveRecord models for database interaction and plain Ruby objects (POROs) for other logic.
    - `app/views`: Primarily used for mailer templates.
    - `config/routes.rb`: Defines all API endpoints.
    - `app/jobs`: Active Job for background processing.
    - `db/migrate`: Database schema changes are managed through migration files.
    - `test`: Minitest is used for testing.
- **Deployment:** The application is deployed to Google Cloud Run. Deployment manifests are located in the `run/` directory for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `prod`).
- **Coding Style:** Follows standard Ruby and Rails conventions.
- **Data Handling:** Controllers receive parameters, interact with models, and serialize model data into JSON responses.

## 4. Code Generation & Modification Guidelines

- When adding new features, adhere to the Rails "Convention over Configuration" philosophy.
- Do not create service classes (Service Objects).
- Use Rails generators (`bin/rails g`) to create new models, controllers, migrations, etc., to ensure consistency.
- Business logic should primarily reside in models. For logic tied to a database table, use an ActiveRecord model. For logic not directly tied to a table, create a plain Ruby model (a class that does not inherit from `ApplicationRecord`).
- All new API endpoints must be defined in `config/routes.rb`.
- Ensure new features are covered by tests in the `test/` directory.

## 5. Commit Message Generation Rules

When generating commit messages, please follow these rules:

- Use conventional commit message format.
- Write in English.
- Use imperative mood.
- Use the present tense.
- Limit the first line to 50 characters or less.
- Separate the subject from the body with a blank line.
- Ensure each line in the body does not exceed 72 characters by inserting line breaks where necessary, including within sentences.
- Separate distinct paragraphs with a blank line.
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
- Reference pull requests.
